- **User-friendly Interface** – Simple and intuitive design for a smooth experience.

## Technologies ⚙️

This app is built using the following technologies:
- **React** – for building the user interface.
- **TypeScript** – for better code organization and type safety.
- **Styled-components** – for styling React components dynamically.
- **Glitch** – for hosting the app online.

## How to Run the Project Locally 🔧

To run the **Bookmark Manager App** on your local machine, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, you need to clone the project repository to your local computer. Open your terminal (Command Prompt, PowerShell, or a terminal of your choice) and run the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
```
This will create a local copy of the repository on your machine.
Once the cloning is complete, navigate into the project directory:

```bash
cd your-repo
```
### 2. Install Dependencies
The project uses npm (Node Package Manager) to manage its dependencies. Before running the app, you must install all the required libraries and packages.
In the project folder, run the following command to install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```
This will look at the package.json file in the project directory and download all the necessary packages for the app to work.

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables (Optional)
If your project requires specific environment variables (like API keys, or URLs), you should add them to a .env file in the root of the project. For example:

arduino
Skopiuj kod
REACT_APP_API_URL=https://your-api-url.com
This step may not be necessary for the Bookmark Manager App if there are no external dependencies, but if you plan to extend the app, you can add environment variables here.

### 4. Run the Application
Now that the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server by running:

bash
Skopiuj kod
npm start
This will launch the app in development mode. By default, it should open your browser and display the app at http://localhost:3000. If the browser does not open automatically, you can manually visit the link in your browser.

### 5. View the Application
Once the app is running, you should see the Bookmark Manager App in your browser. You can now use the app to add, edit, or delete bookmarks locally.

### 6. Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues, here are a few common troubleshooting steps:

Issue: "Command not found" when running npm install or npm start.

Solution: Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. You can check the installation by running node -v and npm -v in the terminal.
Issue: The app is not showing correctly in the browser.

Solution: Try restarting the development server by stopping it (press Ctrl + C in the terminal) and running npm start again.
Issue: Missing environment variables.

Solution: If the app relies on environment variables (e.g., API keys), make sure you have created the .env file in the root directory and added the necessary keys.
### 7. Building the App for Production (Optional)
If you want to deploy your app or run it in production mode locally, you can create an optimized build by running:

bash
```
npm run build
```
This will create a build/ folder containing a production-ready version of your app. You can then serve it using a static server, or deploy it to a platform like Netlify or Vercel.

Once you have followed these steps, you should be able to run and interact with the Bookmark Manager App locally on your machine! 😄
